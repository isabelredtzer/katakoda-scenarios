# Introduction

## Automated Testing
To ensure software quality, the software has to be tested. Every time the source code is changed, the tests need to be repeated. Manually performing these tests with every change is time-consuming. Once created, automated tests will run by themselves with each modification and are less time-consuming and much faster than manual tests. This is an essential part of the DevOps lifecycle. 

## Automated Build
Build automation is a process for creating and building software standardizing the manual responsibilities of developers when updating code. The process entails compiling the new code, executing automated tests on it, and publishing it to a centralized repository. 

Build automation is important to DevOps since it must be established before an organization can implement other processes, including continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment.
